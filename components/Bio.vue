                A band from Sweden that started out in 2015 as 10-11 year
                olds trying to play heavy music has now turned into one of the most promising acts on the map today.
                <br><br>
                With two albums already released with great reviews from sites like Metalinjection, they have already toured
                in both Sweden & Europe and played at festivals like Sweden Rock Festival, Skogsr√∂jet and Putte I Parken.
                They have become known for their chaotic live show, unique sound and creative mix of
                genres.
                <br><br>
                Their latest record, <i>For the Next Species</i>, was recorded and produced by Mikael Gottberg during
                the spring of 2023, and is yet to be released...
