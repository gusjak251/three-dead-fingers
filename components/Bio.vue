                A band from Sweden that started out in 2015 as 10-11 year
                olds trying to play heavy music has turned into one of the most promising acts on the map today.
                <br><br>
                They have released two full-length albums and received great reviews from sites like Metalinjection. At the
                same
                time, they have managed to tour in both Sweden & Europe and played at big festivals such as Sweden Rock
                Festival, Skogsr√∂jet and Putte I Parken.
                Their chaotic live show, unique sound and creative mix of
                genres is what sets them apart.
                <br><br>
                Their latest record, <i>For the Next Species</i>, was recorded and produced by Mikael Gottberg during
                the spring of 2023, and is yet to be released...
